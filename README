## Git-From-Scratch

I work with `git` for like a lot of time and listening to the terms that I don'
t have enough knowledge gives me a hit.

So, here I am, figuring out how git may work. 
It is just a trial where I will try to figure out how `git` `may` work. Since I am not 
interested in reading the original mirror of @git so I though of challenging myself a bit.

## Vision
Since It is just a timepass project, therefore I will be using it to `Version Control` a simple 
file that contains data as
```
1
2
3
4
```
Any change in the file will be checked and then stored. I will make it a heavy VCS and tnen 
make it comply with space efficiency (ik it is difficult to do, when you're going on with 
the intuition that your hypothesis is correct :P)


## Language

I will be using Javascript for making this project. I don't have any specific reason for 
choosing this language. Let's just go with the flow :P
